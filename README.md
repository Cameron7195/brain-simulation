# brain-simulation
A pile of probabilistic, interconnected, neurons, left to activate each other in complex, never-ending loops. Inspired by the adage "neurons that fire together, wire together". Complex dynamics and emergent structures form.

All of the main application functionality is governed by the c++ files in the brain_src folder, while the ogl_bin_xcode and ogl_master folders merely handle the backend graphics functionality.
